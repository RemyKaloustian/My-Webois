## Client side of Webois

Done in ReactJS using the Google Maps wrapper for React : https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/#usage--configuration

The goal of the app on client side is to either ...

Profile 1 : Basic  driving user
 - Display the current position on the map 
 - Show accidents on the map
 - Notifies for nearby accidents
 - Can comment on an accident

 Profile 2 : Manager
 - See the accidents in a list
 - Remove an accident
